                    In June 2023, SPEC Guiding Elder Carole Christopher, along with two SPEC members, had the privilege of meeting
                    with MP Joyce Murray. The focal point of the discussion centered around the SPEC Elders Circle, delve deeper
                    into its purpose and significance. Additionally, the opportunity was seized to align this program within the
                    broader spectrum of SPEC's initiatives, engaging in fruitful conversations about our other programs.

                    A Fruitful Visit by MP Joyce Murray, Minister of Fisheries, Oceans, and the Canadian Coastguard

                <p className="mb-4">
                    MP Joyce Murray, Minister of Fisheries, Oceans, and the Canadian Coastguard, paid my board colleague Enzo Casal,
                    Repair Cafe Coordinator Brain Wong a visit of which we are very pleased with the outcome. While the SPEC Elders
                    Circle, a federally funded program by New Horizons for Seniors, remained the primary topic of conversation, we
                    also seized the opportunity to place it within the broader context of SPEC's initiatives and engage in
                    discussions about other programs.

                <p className="mb-4">
                    We delved into the Elders Circle's vision, the development of our successful CORE Legacy-Making course, and its
                    integration into our current programming on Becoming an Organizational Guiding Elder.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    I reached for the words to succinctly tell the story of how the Elders Circle started and my vision of western
                    Elders reclaiming a socially meaningful role and its importance for our physical, mental, and cognitive
                    well-being. I shared my inspiration as a SPEC Guiding Elder, how it fostered a broader perspective on our work,
                    structures, and culture. Additionally, I expressed my desire to extend this growth opportunity to other elders
                    involved in community organizations. Older adults who can see themselves and can function as mature elders can
                    bring wisdom, skills, and experience to organizations that help to knit the fabric of our common life together.

                    Minister Murray resonated with this vision and our efforts to make the elders topic of conversation available
                    and accessible to younger generations. She shared a story of her husband's honorary title as an Elder by
                    Indigenous people from his decades-long business operation in the region.
